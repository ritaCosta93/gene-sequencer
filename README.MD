# Gene Sequencing Simulation

## Introduction

This interactive JavaScript simulation visualizes gene sequencing and chromosome formation, utilizing the HTML5 canvas for dynamic rendering. It's an educational tool, demonstrating the principles of genetics through programmed motion and grouping behavior of gene sequence representations.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Animation**: Sequences move and collide on a canvas, simulating the random nature of gene sequencing.
- **Chromosome Formation**: Groups of sequences form chromosomes, reflecting biological processes.
- **Visual Interface**: A clean and engaging graphical display with categories like "People," "Food," "Places," "Emotions," "Colors," and "Numbers."
- **Educational Purpose**: Serves as a visual aid for explaining genetic sequencing and chromosome organization.
